<h1><green> PHP </green></h1>


<h2> Why PHP? </h2>


<p> Because it is one of the most used server-side scripting languages on this earth.</p>

<h2> How to use PHP:</h2>

<p> You can't just run php on your computer, php lives on the <i> server </i>, so to actually
	run php code, you have to have a server to run it on <b><i> or </b></i> a local server setup like WAMP or MAMP. </p>

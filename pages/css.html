<h2> What is CSS? </h2>

<p> Fordi <dfn title="Cascading Style Sheet">CSS</dfn> er awesome og relativt enkelt. Programmering er det dog ikke. </p> 

<h2> How to use CSS </h2>

<p> CSS is (usually) kept in separate files within the same folder as your .html files. In this day and age, it has become popular to use media queries and the <span class="cssTxt">@ import</span> selector to select which CSS file to load. The logic behind this is simple: when surfing a webpage on your mobile phone, you don't need or want the display of the content to be identical as on a desktop computer; you want (most people don't even know about the different CSS files ofcourse) the same content (information in different forms), but the design is different to accomodate the smaller screen size. Margin and paddings aren't cool on a phone! And actually, if you need an enviormental argument to change your webdesigning habits, when adding enough bits and bytes, it could actually impact the enviorment as an end result. YAY! </p>
